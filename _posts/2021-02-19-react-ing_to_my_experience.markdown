### My FlatIron experience has been an unforgettable rollercoaster.

In comparison to the knowledge I entered the school with in the beginning, I've learned much more than I could have imagined. I actually have the confidence to be able to look at code, read it and comprehend it (since there's always more to learn). Over the past few months, I've created mini applications because of the foundation that FlatIron has prepared me with - a foundation that is rooted in a new-found, internal sense of confidence, because I actually have tangible projects that I've created and can work on.

For my final Javascript/React-Redux project, I created a simple job application tracker with a todo list. I was able to create a list of tasks I needed to do for the day, add jobs that I've applied to, and notes about them/their current status. Even though it was simple, this project definitely required me to use everything that I've learned so far, to create an application ***from scratch***. 

One of the main issues that I encountered with this project, was navigating my understanding of Redux. State management, actions and reducers seemed very confusing to me at first, but after a lot of trial and error - I've finally been able to come to an understanding of it. I had a huge issue that lasted me an entire day, only to find that it was a simple fix in the backend!

Errors like those are what showed me that my understanding had truly become comprehensive, that everything really was tied together. 

I am happy to have made it this far, and am extremely excited about what's in ***store*** for me in the future, as I continue to learn more languages and develop as a Software Engineer!
