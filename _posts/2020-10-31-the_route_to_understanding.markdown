While doing this project, I actually felt like a Software Engineer because I was able to troubleshoot errors without spending too much time on them!

I finally understood **why** certain things weren't working (instead of misunderstanding the error messages) - I just had to figure out the solution. I had to remember to check and see what values were being returned with 'binding.pry', so that I knew what I had access to manipulate. With access to ActiveRecord associations, I also had a whole list of methods that I could use to assist me. I didn't have to spend too much time defining methods, I only had to know what was appropriate to call them on. 

While doing this project, there were two things that my instructor kept relaying to me:
* to render a view and redirect to a route
* the computer does exactly what you tell it to

Once I completely understood what it meant to "render a view" and "redirect to a route", my controllers and view pages became a lot clearer to navigate and edit. For some reason, I had an issue with understanding the connection between the post routes in the view pages with the routes found in the controllers. I also had to have a small talk with myself and actually read the code that I was writing, and walk myself through it - out loud! Sometimes things can get so confusing if they stay jumbled in our mind, but once the thoughts are actually spoken out loud, a connection happens. It was also helpful for me to create a small diagram of the connections between the views and the routes in the controllers - having a visual picture really helped me understand how information was being passed.

This project really helped me to understand more about my learning style and helped me see more clearly on my path towards becoming a Software Engineer.
