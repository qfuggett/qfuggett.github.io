**Wow**.  

In the beginning, this project really blew me away for a moment. It gave me the opportunity to gather everything that I've learned and demonstrate my knowledge by creating an application that others can interact with.

I started the project having already felt a little overwhelmed from the First Mile. There was so much information to absorb, process and execute (through the labs) on a daily basis, that I felt as if I didn't have time to breathe. Was I really learning everything or was I simply "getting through" the labs? 

Doing this project helped me to see that everything is a process. As a beginner, this is something that I had to come to realize - that there are steps towards being fully *cemented* in ones understanding of something. It wasn't going to happen overnight!

I had to create my own learning intervention by asking for help from others - especially my Cohort Lead, Nancy - and using the help from these sessions to check my understanding. A learning intervention is a set of steps taken to prevent a student from falling behind. After I received help, I would search through Google, Youtube and some of the previous lessons to review my understanding of the corrections that I received from my help sessions.

I've found that writing my code down in a notebook and even explaining my code to a friend (who had no knowledge of ruby or programming in general) really helped everything come together in my mind.

I had some trouble with fully understanding how to properly use and place ````binding.pry````.  Simple, right? Unfortunately, I went through a lot of trial and error by placing my ````binding.pry```` at the bottom of my methods, instead of at the top. The return values would be different if placed at the bottom! 

Through the labs, I've found that using ````binding.pry```` is extremely helpful when trying to find what the values of certain variables are and what some of my methods are returning. Once I got extremely comfortable with placing my binding properly, everything took off from there.

I'm glad that I caught myself before I fell behind! It is easy to drown in a sea of despair when you are already frustrated. Now that I'm looking back at my project, I see that my understanding of Ruby (so far) has come together.
