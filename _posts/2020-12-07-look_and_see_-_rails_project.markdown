*This project really brought everything together that we've been learning over the past few months.*

For this project, I decided to create a **Skin Shelf** app that allowed users to create a routine and their corresponding products. I am what you'd consider to be a *skin care junkie*, so this is very similar to an app that I already use on my phone! I wrote everything down, step by step, of what I had to do:

1. Set up the project with Devise
2. Get authentication working (I chose Github)
3. Create my Models, Controllers, Views & tables
3. Figure out my `has_many` and `belongs_to` relationships
4. Set up validations with error messages
4. Set up my RESTful routes
4. What did I want my `scope method` to do?
5. Try to make everything as Dry as possible

Although I did not get everything completed in this order, writing out my steps in a list helped tremendously. It's easier to envision a project's completion when things are down on paper and not just jumbled up and flying about in your head. Next time, I'm gonna be sure to give each large step it's own space, so that I can write down notes, questions & things that I need to research & study more for later.

The most challenging part of this project was truly understanding the nested routes, how they worked and how to actually use them correctly. I had a similar issue in the Sinatra project with making the connection between the routes and controllers. I just simply needed to `rake routes` to see exactly what I need to type to get to where I need to go! It's as simple as that, but for some reason, I came to understand this later on in the project.  Sometimes, the browser will suggest a route path, but that doesn't mean that it's correct! I have to look at what I'm working with...

Programming really comes down to **paying attention** to what I am telling the computer to do and understanding that it will do just that and nothing else!
