**I can't believe that I'm near the end of this course and am headed towards graduation! **

As someone who had minimal programming experience when starting this bootcamp, I was intimidated at first - but was extremely excited to get started with learning. It has been a truly rigorous experience, but I feel proud of myself for getting this far in the program, when my past attempts at programming had been short-lived.

Shifting to javascript was.....interesting. Although the approach to frontend programming is pretty straightforward, I had trouble with wrapping my head around the syntax of this language. The punctuation and curly brackets did something strange to my mind - it was just a different way of reading and writing another programming language. Ultimately, I think I had allowed previous notions from others of the language being hard to affect my views on its difficulty in the early stages of learning during this module.

For some reason, with this language I am prone to making more typos than usual (in comparison to Ruby). I had to work very slowly when doing this project, but the slower pace gave me time to understand my code much more because with Javascript, I voiced my thoughts outloud more while working. 

This project really helped me to get more closely involved with the debugging process, and I've learned a lot about javascript simply by fixing the errors I encountered. So...although no one likes errors, I've found now that error-driven development might be a method of programming that I will consider doing in my future projects.
